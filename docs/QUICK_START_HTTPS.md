# Quick Start: HTTPS Proxy for Storyblok

## One-Time Setup

Run the setup script:

```bash
./scripts/setup-https.sh
```

Then install the proxy tool globally:

```bash
npm install -g local-ssl-proxy
```

## Daily Usage

### Option 1: Start Everything Together (Recommended)

```bash
npm run dev:https
```

This starts both the Next.js dev server (port 3000) and HTTPS proxy (port 3010).

### Option 2: Run Separately

Terminal 1:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Terminal 2:
```bash
npm run proxy
```
